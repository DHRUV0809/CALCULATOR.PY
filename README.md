Simple Calculator in Python
Description
This project is a basic calculator implemented in Python that performs simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two user inputs and allows the user to select an operation to perform on these numbers.

Features
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/) (with error handling for division by zero)
Error Handling
The calculator handles division by zero and informs the user if an invalid operation is selected.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Future Improvements
Add support for more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., exponentiation, square roots).
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
